# BLOGS API ‚å®Ô∏è

Project developed in the Back-end Module at the [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) course.

### üéØ
The project goal was to develop a database using Sequelize and a REST API to manage a blog with the MSC software architecture using Node and Express. <br>
The API presents all the `CRUD` operations. <br>
JWT is present in the authentications, meanwhile, Joi handles the validations.
